Steps to run the project tasks:

1) Open NetBeans IDE.

2) Import the files all the three zip files one by one.

3) Run the index.jsp file for Project1Task1 and Project1Task2 to execute and to get the output through the browser.

4) For Project1Task3, I have used BlueStacks Android simulator to open the Android browser. Run the file index.jsp and use the address http://10.0.2.2:8080/Project1Task3/ to get the output.
